** Sure

- [X] use ph-status-busy only as a concrete file semaphore, e.g. set it
  to a file name in ph-project-close, then in ph-kill-file hook do
  cl-return only if ph-status-busy == buffer-file-name.
- [X] leave cl-lib 'require' only in ph-u.el

** Unsure

- [ ] recursive check for subprojects
- [ ] make ph-kill-buffer-hook buffer local
- [ ] title in modeline
- [ ] temporally disable auto-revert in ph-project-close
