* Ongoing

** Sure

- [X] progress-reporter for ph-project-open & ph-project-close
- [ ] inject to before-save-hook to mitigate (set-visited-file-name) damage

** Unsure

- [ ] recursive check for subprojects
- [ ] make ph-kill-buffer-hook buffer local
- [X] use semaphore instead of removing/adding hooks
- [ ] temporally disable auto-revert in ph-project-close
